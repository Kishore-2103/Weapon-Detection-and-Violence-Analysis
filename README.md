This Project helps to detect the Human Behavioural activities and also detect the Weapons in the public.
This Project uses the Following algorithm
   1. VGG
   2. Transfer Learning
   3. OpenCV
      Detecting various kinds of weapons and simultaneously predicting the violence is the difficult task in the society. There are many types of weapons like guns and knives, there are approximately 20 types of guns classified according to their structure of the gun and their bullets and the knives can be forged by numerous structures so, it is hard to detect. By detecting the presence of the weapon helps to stop the gun trafficking in the public places by merging in the public. The detecting of the violence can be used efficiently in the public meetings where the small initiation of the violence leads to the major chaos. This study aims to prevent the both conditions by detecting the presence of weapon and also detecting violence using various methodology like VGG16 or VGG19 and YOLO V4 algorithms for best efficiency. This study focuses on the accuracy observed from various algorithms.
      
The Major advantage is we can monitor the wide area just by camera and system and we can identify the abnormal activities or weapon identification.
